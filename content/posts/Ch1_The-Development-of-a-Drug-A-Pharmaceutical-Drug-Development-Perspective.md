# Critical steps enabling early development 



Reducing attrition biomedical approaches

- leverage pre-existing information including bioinformatics approaches 

- integrating non-clinical information to predict clinical properties of NME 

- optimize the operational costs to gain timely information in early trials

## non-clinical pharmacokinetic (PK) studies 

-  PK profile in animals is first used to optimize subsequent formulation

-  support non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology studies



## pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) models

to design

-  non-clinical toxicology studies in animals

-  determine of drug requirements for CMC

-  Time points for PK sampling in humans

-  estimate the safe starting dose

-  assess the benefit/risk for a NME

## pharmacology and toxicology studies

## Non-clinical Pharmacology Models

- PDX(patient-derived xenografts) **BETTER THAN** CDX(non-clinical cell line derived xenograft) 

- Notice differences of the species-specific immune system

- human organoids may help

### Non-clinical Toxicology Studies

based on ICH S9 

- most relevant species: generally a rodent and non-rodent species

- determine the no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL)

true positive concordance rate between animal and human: 71% 



## biomarker development plans

Success rate: 13% vs. 7%



# Immuno-oncology

- include therapeutic vaccines and NME targeting immune cells

- not have an immediate antitumor effect and long treatment times

- Monitoring immune responses for efficacy and safety



# Planning for FiH study

## Considerations

- Shoud be designed with sufficient decision points

- no longer just for safety and PK

- patient selection is key: based on non-clinical model and incorporate PD markers

- Reducing attrition

     - anticipated biologically efficacious dose and dose schedule based on PK/PD models

     - safe starting dose based on non-clinical toxicology studies

     - biomarker plan to identify or enrich for patients to respond

     - reduce operational uncertainties by selecting and collaborating with trial centers 

     - well trained staff across all parts of the study



## FiH design

![Fig 1.3](https://i.loli.net/2021/03/05/UqGnSctTQOgw869.png)



Part A: main objective is to confirm the predicted toxicity, PK and, ideally, the PD profile

- confirm the prediction of the biological active dose

- define the biological effective dose (BED) and receptor occupancy



Part B: expansion cohorts



OR flexible design of early phase studies can accelerate the approval

# Accelerate Approval

## Additional Studies



- initiate stability studies as early as possible

- clinical pharmacology studies 

    - incorporated in ongoing studies or stand-alone

    - include DDI, food effect, QTc, renal & hepatice insufficiency, BA/BE studies

    - Started when the final or pre-final formulation is developed

- Pediatric asap

## Regulatory Implications

- Biomarker-driven clinical development have shortened time to registration and may reduced the trials

- FDA  “accelerated approval” VS. EMA Prime designation

      - patient-reported outcomes in EMA
    
      - companion diagnostic in FDA
