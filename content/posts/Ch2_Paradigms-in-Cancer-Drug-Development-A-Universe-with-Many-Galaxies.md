### Main differences between four established paradigms in oncology early drug development

### Cytotoxic Chemotherapeutics (CHTs)

- Both efficacy and toxicity show sigmoid dose-response relationship
      - Underlying assumption: the mechanism resulting in toxicity is similar to the mechanism leading to efficacy
- Tumor growth follow Gompertzian function
  - less time between treatments likely more efficient 
  - dose regime, dose, timing, duration, and schedule, matters
- Find therapeutic window
  - Conventionally, 1/10 of 10% lethal dose (LD10) in mice **or** 1/6 of the highest NOAEL in non-rodent
  - Accelerated titration designs advocate for single-patient cohorts at early dose levels
- ADC (antibody- drug conjugate) considerations
  - Rational selection of target antigens, expressed in normal cells at very low levels
  - Careful modification of the mAb (e.g., selective mutations to improve linker and payload distribution)
  - Improvement in antibody- engineered delivery systems (e.g., immunoliposomes)
  - Consideration of different payloads according to each tumoral context (e.g., tubulin polymerization inhibitors for breast cancer)
  - definition of its optimal stoichiometry (e.g., ratio of CHT molecules per antibody)

*Dose-response-toxicity relationship curves and therapeutic window for CHTs. The dose-response curve for traditional CHTs follows a sigmoidal shape, slowly rising until a minimum efficacy threshold is met (minimum efficacious dose, MED), followed by a linear phase that then reaches a plateau. The antitumor activity occurs in the linear phase, although extreme doses of CHT do not translate into higher activity rates once the plateau phase is reached; on the contrary, they might correlate with toxicity towards normal tissues (maximum tolerated dose, MTD). The therapeutic window is the range of doses comprised in the area where the curves separate, and comprises those doses that achieve the greatest therapeutic benefit without resulting in unacceptable side effects. ADC technology offers the possibility of widening this therapeutic window and efficaciously targeting selected antigen-expressing cancer cells*

### Molecularly Targeted Agents (MTAs)

#### "Hallmarks" of cancer

- insensitivity to anti-growth signals
- self-sufficiency in growth signals
- limitless replicative potential
- apoptosis evasion
- sustained angiogenesis
- tissue invasion and metastasis
- instability and mutation
- immune response evasion
- reprogramming of energy metabolism
- tumor-promoting inflammation

*Dose-response-toxicity relationship curves and integration of effect markers for defining 
the  biologically  effective  dose  (BED)  of  a  certain  MTA.  The  traditional  CHT  dose-response- 
toxicity sigmoidal curves have been reshaped with this second paradigm in EDD: very low doses 
of a MTA might be sufficient for hitting the desired target. Two scenarios can occur at higher 
doses: either sustained efficacy once the target modulation has reached a plateau (dotted red line), 
or a progressive decrease in clinical benefit due to loss of selectivity (straight red line). Toxicity 
might occur at very high doses or might never occur, and in certain occasions, the MTD may not 
be reached with traditional toxicity-guiding escalation designs (blue curve). Hence, to define an 
optimal BED, many markers of effect, pharmacodynamics, toxicity or radiological markers should 
be integrated into novel Ph1 designs developing MTAs*

#### Characteristics

- basis for a certain MTA: the modulation of a cellular target that could translate into anti-tumoral activity

- at higher doses, efficacy may not increase and selectivity may even be lost, with off-target toxicities

- BED (biologically effective dose) by evaluating markers of drug effect is essential as MTD may not archive 

- proof-of-mechanism: MTA Ph1 need to demonstrate the modulation of the putative target in tissues of interest, by identifying pharmacodynamic biomarkers 

- priori understanding of the biology

  - PD readout is necessary, it might not be sufficient

    presence of PD modulation might not fully demonstrate that the MTA is acting via the intended target

  - additional effect markers 

    - target engagement (e.g., toxicity derived from blocking a specific tyrosine kinase receptor) 
    - disease progression markers (e.g., changes in tumor size)
    - Mechanism-based adverse events
    - metabolic or radiomic changes (such as changes in density) 
  
- may use modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST)  and the Choi criteria

- specific studies

  - some MTAs were implemented in healthy volunteer studies 
  - neo-adjuvant window-of-opportunity studies and Phase 0 studies in patients to confirm the hypothetical target modulation of a specific MTA
  
- companion diagnostics but validation is complex

  - acquire a comprehensive understanding of the tumor biology
  - multiple pre-analytical procedures might interfere in the interpretation of the results for validating a specific biomarker, need SOPs for collecting and processing biological speciments
  - rare molecularly-selected populations may be difficult to recruit

### Immune Checkpoint-Targeted Monoclonal Antibodies (ICT mAbs)

#### crucial premises

- capacity of immune adaptability and memory that could produce **long-term antitumor effects** and increase the response rate

- unique MoAs expanded the opportunities for testing new **combination** strategies 

- targeting the immune system instead of transformed malignant cells offered the potential to 
  effectively treat **multiple tumor types**

#### limitations

* lack of preclinical studies that represent the human disease

* immunotoxicology and immunopharmacology assays have not yet been fully optimized for ICT mAbs 

* animal models are not able to faithfully recapitulate the characteristics of the human immune system

  

  TeGenero incident, first-in-human trial of TGN141 in 2006, imply the challenges of dealing with the innate unpredictability of immune-modulation and the limitations of animal models due to the particularities of the immune system of each species

#### Early development

* Most Ph1 for ICT mAbs have implemented a traditional 3+3 escalation

  - dose-efficacy and dose-toxicity curves are less defined for these antibodies

  - standard strategy for defining an optimal RP2D does not apply

  - none declared MTD  

* long time to assess efficacy and unpredictability of irAEs

  - ICT mAb-related irAEs can appear at any time during their administration
  - new toxicity profile
  
    - new antibodies targeting CD40, OX40, ICOS, or GITR
  
    - may trigger a life-threatening cytokine release syndrome, hyper-immune stimulation, or uncontrolled autoimmune reactions
  
    - recognizing and managing these toxicities should be run in EDD units with experience 
      of managing irAEs and close access to intensive care units
  
    - Corticosteroids and immunosuppressants have been routinely used for managing irAEs
   - immune-related response criteria (irRC) and irRECIST
     - Unusual and unexpected response patterns in ICT mAbs,  pseudo-progressions, delayed or even dissociated responses
     - more subjective and progression free survival (PFS) evaluation may biased
       - everolimus demonstrated a benefit in OS favoring the IT arm, but not in PFS
       - hazard ratios between curves are not constant over time
- complementary PK/PD and safety markers were used for fine-tuning their RP2D as well as  immuno-biologically effective dose (imBED). Follows should be integrated into the final RP2D 
  - lower adverse events lasting throughout multiple cycles
  - isolated harmful grade 3/4 events that occur beyond the DLT-evaluation period
* importance of finding appropriate predictive immune-biomarkers 
  - expression of PD-L1, presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) at the invasive tumor margin, existence of a high tumor mutation burden (TMB) with a specific neo-antigen signature, 
    or the detection of microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H)/mismatch-repair-deficient (dMMR) tumors 
  - immunohistochemistry (IHC) assays heterogeneity
  - On May 23, 2017, the FDA approved pembrolizumab for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with MSI-H or dMMR solid tumors, **irrespective of their origin**

*Overall survival (OS) curve and probability of severe G3-5 immune-related adverse events (irAEs) with ICT mAbs. In the case of rapidly progressing malignancies with high tumor growth rates, Kaplan Meier curves for OS with ICT mAbs typically show a rapid decrease during the first months of therapy, then enter a slowly descending curve (red line). Those patients who benefit from the ICT mAb and survive beyond 24 months tend to reach a plateau and may represent a tail of long-term survivors. Most of the G3-5 irAEs described with ICT mAbs appear within the first 3–6 months of the start of therapy, with no clear linear dose-dependent relationship. ICT mAbs are generally safe, although gastrointestinal colitis or diarrhea (light blue line), endocrine toxicity (lilac line), skin-rash or pruritus (dark blue line), and liver toxicity (turquoise line) are among the most common irAEs, with maximum reported rates for all tumor types in the main clinical trials for anti-CTLA-4, anti-PD-1, and anti-PD-L1 ICT mAbs of around 12%, 4%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. Although irAEs are unpredictable and can occur at any time during the administration of these drugs, a peculiar pattern has been observed, as illustrated in this figure. Although most of these severe irAEs can be solved completely with early detection and adequate medication, a delayed response to the ICT mAb cannot be excluded even 1 year after starting administration, and oncologists must keep such responses in mind during the follow-up of exposed patients (dotted lines). Immune-related endocrine disorders (hypothyroidism, hypophysitis, adrenal insufficiency) tend to occur later during the treatment, but in most of cases, patients will require permanent hormone replacement*



### Epigenetic Drugs (EPDs)

**epigenetics**: the branch of biology which studies the causal interactions between genes and their products, which bring the phenotype into being

####  epigenetic patterns behind the development of diseases

- Histone modification 
- methylation of cytosines in CpGs
- ATP-dependent complexes involved in chromatin remodeling
- non-coding RNA interference transcripts (miRNAs) in post-transcriptional RNA silencing mechanisms

#### major critical points

- how we can ensure a certain degree of specificity for the target

  - Most of the epigenetic targets are essential proteins ubiquitously expressed throughout the body

- premise that cancer cells might rely more than normal cells on the epigenetic regulator(NOT TRUE)

- many silenced genes might be unintentionally activated by EPDs and cause deleterious effects in normal cells

- epigenetic modifications are usually reversible

- DLT definition and efficacy assessment are two major challenges 

- EPDs are relatively well-tolerated drugs

  - take time to efficiently modulate the epigenome and reprogram the targeted cancer cells

  - need patients to stay on trial for longer periods of time 

- Definition of respective PD biomarkers
  - engaging its target at the chromatin level in each specific cellular setting
  - epigenetic-selected populations
  - identification of specific patterns of epigenetic modulation in cancers, enrichment-based development

- combinatorial regimen with other anticancer agents as monotherapy effect is modest

  - directly upregulating the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I/II proteins and adhesion/co-stimulatory molecules

  - altering cytokine production, supporting their combination with ICT mAbs

  - lower the apoptotic threshold within a tumor cell

  - reversing epigenetic-modulated mechanisms of resistance to these cancer drugs

  - EPDs enhance the tumor-killing effects of radiotherapy

  - caution:  epigenome alteration: normal and malignant epigenetic regulation is context-cell specific

- EPDs have shown limited success in epithelial solid tumors
